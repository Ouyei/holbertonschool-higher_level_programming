# Hello World, Python!

This is the first project made with Python and consists of knowing some of its bases.

# Learning Objectives

* Why Python programming is awesome?
* Who created Python?
* Who is Guido van Rossum?
* Where does the name Python come from?
* What is the Zen of Python?
* How to use the Python interpreter?
* How to print text and variables using print?
* How to use strings?
* What are indexing and slicing in Python?
* How to apply the syntax code of [pycodestyle](https://pypi.org/project/pycodestyle/)?

# Tasks

## Run Python file

Write a Shell script that runs a Python script.

The Python file name will be saved in the environment variable `$PYFILE`

**Solution:** [0-run](https://github.com/Ouyei/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/blob/main/0x00-python-hello_world/0-run)

```

```

## Run inline

Write a Shell script that runs Python code.

The Python code will be saved in the environment variable `$PYCODE`

**Solution:** [1-run_inline](https://github.com/Ouyei/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/blob/main/0x00-python-hello_world/1-run_inline)

```

```

## Hello, print

Write a Python script that prints exactly `"Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle`, followed by a new line.

**Solution:** [2-print.py](https://github.com/Ouyei/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/blob/main/0x00-python-hello_world/2-print.py)

```

```

## Print integer

Complete this [source code](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x00.py/blob/master/3-print_number.py) in order to print the integer stored in the variable `number`, followed by `Battery street`, followed by a new line.

* The output of the script should be:
    * the number, followed by `Battery street`,
    * followed by a new line
* You are not allowed to cast the variable `number` into a string
* Your code must be 3 lines long
* You have to use the new print numbers [tips](https://pyformat.info/#number) (with `.format(...)`)

**Solution:** [3-print_number.py](https://github.com/Ouyei/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/blob/main/0x00-python-hello_world/3-print_number.py)

```

```

## Print float

Complete the [source code](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x00.py/blob/master/4-print_float.py) in order to print the float stored in the variable `number` with a precision of 2 digits.

* The output of the program should be:
    * `Float:`, followed by the float with only 2 digits
    * followed by a new line
* You are not allowed to cast `number` to string
* You have to use the new print numbers [tips](https://pyformat.info/#number) (with `.format(...)`)

**Solution:** [4-print_float.py](https://github.com/Ouyei/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/blob/main/0x00-python-hello_world/4-print_float.py)

```

```

## Print string

Complete this [source code](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x00.py/blob/master/5-print_string.py) in order to print 3 times a string stored in the variable str, followed by its first 9 characters.

* The output of the program should be:
    * 3 times the value of `str`
    * followed by a new line
    * followed by the 9 first characters of `str`
    * followed by a new line
* You are not allowed to use any loops or conditional statement
* Your program should be maximum 5 lines long

**Solution:** [5-print_string.py](https://github.com/Ouyei/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/blob/main/0x00-python-hello_world/5-print_string.py)

```

```

## Play with strings

Complete this [source code](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x00.py/blob/master/6-concat.py) to print Welcome to Holberton School!

* You are not allowed to use any loops or conditional statements.
* You have to use the variables `str1` and `str2` in your new line of code
* Your program should be exactly 5 lines long

**Solution:** [6-concat.py](https://github.com/Ouyei/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/blob/main/0x00-python-hello_world/6-concat.py)

```

```

## Copy - Cut - Paste

Complete this [source code](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x00.py/blob/master/7-edges.py)

* You are not allowed to use any loops or conditional statements
* Your program should be exactly 8 lines long
* `word_first_3` should contain the first 3 letters of the variable `word`
* `word_last_2` should contain the last 2 letters of the variable `word`
* `middle_word` should contain the value of the variable `word` without the first and last letters

**Solution:** [7-edges.py](https://github.com/Ouyei/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/blob/main/0x00-python-hello_world/7-edges.py)

```

```

### Create a new sentence

Complete this [source code](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x00.py/blob/master/8-concat_edges.py) to print `object-oriented programming with Python`, followed by a new line.

* You are not allowed to use any loops or conditional statements
* Your program should be exactly 5 lines long
* You are not allowed to create new variables
* You are not allowed to use string literals

**Solution:** [8-concat_edges.py](https://github.com/Ouyei/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/blob/main/0x00-python-hello_world/8-concat_edges.py)

```

```

### Easter Egg

Write a Python script that prints “The Zen of Python”, by TimPeters, followed by a new line.

* Your script should be maximum 98 characters long (please check with `wc -m 9-easter_egg.py`)

**Solution:** [9-easter_egg.py](https://github.com/Ouyei/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/blob/main/0x00-python-hello_world/9-easter_egg.py)

```
