# Tasks

## Print a list of integers

Write a function that prints all integers of a list.

* Prototype: `def print_list_integer(my_list=[]):`
* Format: one integer per line. See example
* You are not allowed to import any module
* You can assume that the list only contains integers
* You are not allowed to cast integers into strings
* You have to use `str.format()` to print integers
